# üõ†Ô∏è Database Normalization Review Summary

I analyzed the schema to ensure compliance with **Third Normal Form (3NF)**. The schema is well-designed, I have a few several sugestions aimed at reducing redundancy, improving scalability, and enforcing clearer separation of concerns.

## ‚úÖ Summary & Suggested Changes

1. **Normalize `role` ENUM**:
   - Move the `User.role` ENUM into a separate `Role` table.
   - Enables future enhancements like role descriptions or permissions.

2. **Normalize `payment_method` ENUM**:
   - Replace the `payment_method` ENUM with a `PaymentMethod` table.
   - Allows greater flexibility in managing payment options.

3. **Review `total_price` in Booking**:
   - If calculated from `pricepernight √ó nights`, it should not be stored.
   - If prices may change over time, storing it is valid for historical integrity.

4. **Normalize `location` if reused**:
   - If many properties share the same location, consider creating a `Location` table.
